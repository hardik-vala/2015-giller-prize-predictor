# 2015-giller-prize-predictor

My simple [2015 Giller Prize](http://www.scotiabankgillerprize.ca/) predictor.

### How it works

predict.py is well-documented and reading through the main method will show you how my method works. Running predict.py performs a type of grid-search through model parameters and spits out the prediction for both the 2014 and 2015 Giller Prize contests.

### Data

Unfortunately the data, i.e. the set of training, validation, and test novel texts, is not included in the repository and cannot be released for copyright reasons. Regardless, hopefully this repository serves useful for your own computational predictors for literature prize winners.
